## Wave plot
```{r}
x <- seq(0,20,0.01)
y <- c(sin(x))

sin_df <- data.frame(x,y)

head(sin_df, 10)
```

## including plots
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(x,y)

## Replicability and reproducibility
The following text is excerpted from the subtitle of teacher Henry's lecture 2.

Replicability refers to whether or not different experimenters will yield the 
same results from different data when an experiment is repeated under similar
conditions. 

Reproducibility, on the other hand, refers to whether or not different scientists 
will yield the same results by repeating the analysis on the same data. 

Hence reproducibility is a more modest goal than replicability.
